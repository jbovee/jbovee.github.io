Hi, I'm Jacob.

This blog is a place for me to document projects I work on, when I can come up with them. The source for each should be on my [Github](https://github.com/jbovee), unless I specify otherwise. I primarily enjoy and focus on coding projects, though occasionally my whims will take me into other subjects.

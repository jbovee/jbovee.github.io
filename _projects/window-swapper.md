Something that's bothered me for a while is how many actions it can take to swap the positions of two Google Chrome windows that are on different monitors. I'd much prefer to just hit a keyboard shortcut and be done. Or with more than two windows 

- Creating popup
- Adding functionality to popup
- Intercepting keyboard shortcuts
- Moving functionality since keyboard shortcut can't trigger when in popup script
- Background scripts
- Messaging between scripts
- Issues with fullscreen
